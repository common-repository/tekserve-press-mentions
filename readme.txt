Wordpress plugin to create a custom post type for Press Mentions. Includes a (Â¡GENESIS!) template for displaying the single article, and custom fields for author, publication, and url of original article.

== Description ==

It's easy to create simple custom post types, and create functional dependencies in your theme while doing so. Skip it! Use this plugin to create a theme-independent custom post type for your site to maintain and display a collection of articles. We use it for listing articles that we are mentioned in on our site, but you can display any list of external articles, with the original publication, author, and link to the original article. Easy.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `tekservepressmentions` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start creating external article listings in the 'Press Mentions' item in WordPress
4. These articles will be visible in a list at `<yoursiteurl>/press/`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I include a logo or image? =

Add a featured image to the Press Mention, just like a post.

= How do I change the publication date displayed? =

Change the publication date of the Press Mention to the original publication date of the article.

= The template included doesn't work. What gives? =

It's made for the Genesis framework (www.studiopress.com). If you're not using this framework, the template won't do anything but fill your error log. If enough people want a vanilla wordpress version, I'll do it...
